# Thinking Claude

Let Claude think comprehensively before responding!

> **A super quick reminder:**
> Thinking claude **is not aimed for benchmarks or huge leaps in math or something**, since those are pre-determined by the base model (new Claude-3.5 Sonnet).
> I only want to explore how further we could reach with Claude's "deep mindset". That said, when using it in your daily tasks, you will find Claude's inner monolog (thinking process) very very fun and interesting.

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:
1. **Thinking Protocol**: A comprehensive set of instructions that guides Claude to think deeply and systematically before responding
2. **Browser Extension**: A tool that makes Claude's thinking process more readable and manageable in the browser interface

The project is organized into two main directories:
- `extension/`: Contains browser extension implementations
- `model_instructions/`: Contains thinking protocols for different versions

Each directory maintains its own changelog for version tracking.
## Thinking Protocol

The thinking protocol instructs Claude to follow a natural, thorough thought process before providing responses.

## Browser Extension

The browser extension enhances the Claude interface by making the thinking process more manageable:
